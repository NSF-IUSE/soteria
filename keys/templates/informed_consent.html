              <h4>Project Title: User Study of a Web-based Account Management System</h4>
              <h4>Researcher(s): Daqing Hou, Mahesh Banavar, Stephanie Schuckers</h4>
              <h4>Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval number:</h4>
              <br><br>
              <h3>Summary of the study:</h3>
              <p>The project requires a participant to engage in tasks consisting of creating an account
                on a provided website with their personal information, attempting login and account
                recovery multiple times after the initial account creation, and acting as an impostor by
                attacking few other participants. Under the hood, the website capture and utilize
                keystroke timing information to authenticate the users. By letting real users use our
                website,
                our main objective for this study is to evaluate the user experience and performance of
                the authentication process with real users and website. <br><br>Please read the material
                below if you are interested in participating in this study.</p>
              <br><br>
              <h3>What to expect:</h3>
              <p>Are you 18 years of age or older? If your answer no, please do not participate in the
                study. Your responses to the screening questions will be kept on file. <br><br>If you
                continue to participate, you will be asked to create a personal account on this website,
                which requests the following Information from you: names, date of birth, a contact
                address, an email, and a phone number. This information is collected to simulate a user
                experience similar to the
                commercial websites. The phone number and email will be used to receive One-Time
                Password (OTPs) and account recovery links during account recovery and user login
                process. This information will be stored securely on a Clarkson server and only
                accessible to the research team. To simulate the impostor attacks, your information
                listed above would be shared with no more than 20 randomly selected users who
                participate in the same study. By signing this Informed
                Consent, you agree that you will fully respect the confidentiality of such information
                about the other participants that would be shared with you and such information shall
                only be used for the purpose of simulating impostor attacks. <br><br>We estimate each
                login attempts to take 10 to 20 seconds and each account recovery attempt to take 2 to 3
                minutes. To simulate an experience similar to the real user scenario where users trigger
                the forget password mechanism
                because they couldn’t remember their password, we require that these activities (logins,
                account recovery and impostor attacks) be spread out across a period of at least 4 weeks
                with significant activities done every week (but no more than 30 minutes per week).
                During your interaction with the website, it will monitor and record the timing
                information of your keystroke press/release and your mouse. <br><br>If you have any
                questions about this research, you may
                contact Dr. Daqing Hou at dhou@clarkson.edu.</p>
              <br><br>
              <h3>Risks and discomforts to you if you take part in this study:</h3>
              <p>There is no more than minimal risk associated with participating in this study. There are
                no side effects from the process of data collection. No special physical, psychological,
                or social conditions are necessary. If potential participants have a psychological
                aversion to the procedures related to any of the biometric technology, they may decline
                to participate at any point in the study. No medical supervision is necessary. If you
                decline to participate before
                completing a session, you will not be compensated. Subjects can discontinue
                participation at any time. Such discontinuation will not involve penalty or loss of
                benefits to which subjects are otherwise entitled. <br><br>There is an expected concern
                regarding privacy/confidentiality for participants taking part in this study. Personal
                Information collected in this study (full name, date of birth, address, email, and
                phone), will be protected and stored in a secure
                server and accessed by only the researchers. This information is collected to simulate
                an authentic user experience similar to commercial websites. To simulate the impostor
                attacks, the above information would be shared with no more than 20 other randomly
                selected participants who have agreed to keep such information confidential and use the
                shared information only for the purpose of this study. <br><br>During the study, if any
                part of the data is extracted from
                the database, standard encryption schemes will be used at all time. Any database
                transfers from the server will be encrypted with SSL prior to the transfer. All the
                equipment (Computers, Laptops, hard disk, etc.), software and accounts used in this
                study are fully dedicated to this project and will not be shared with any other research
                project. In addition, the data will never leave the lab space on any type of device
                (Laptop, flash disk, hard drive). Only the
                research team will have access to the collected data when it is extracted out of the
                database. <br><br>The data will be kept for 5 years and will be discarded afterward.</p>
              <br><br>
              <h3>The benefits to you if you take part in this study:</h3>
              <p>Beyond the compensation, there are no direct benefits to you, but the knowledge gained
                may be of benefit to society as it may help to improve identification and prevent
                digital fraud through the use of behavioral biometrics. <br><br>What will you receive
                for taking part in this study: You will be compensated $10 after creating an account and
                completing 100 login attempts, $10 after completing 20 account recovery attempts, $15
                after completing impostor attacks
                (both login and account recovery) on 5 users each for 10 times. An extra $5 will be
                awarded if you successfully break into a provided account as an impostor. To simulate an
                experience similar to the real user scenario where users trigger the forget password
                mechanism because they couldn’t remember their password, we expect that these tasks
                (logins, account recovery and impostor attacks) be spread out across a period of at
                least 4 weeks with sufficient activities
                done every week (but less than 0.5 hour of effort per week). </p>
